# Python CLI Calculator 

A command-line calculator built with Python as part of my learning journey.  
This project goes beyond basic arithmetic and focuses on **input validation, program flow, state management, and user experience in a CLI environment**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This calculator allows users to perform calculations interactively in the terminal.  
It supports continuing calculations using the previous result, resetting the calculator state, viewing calculation history, and exiting the program cleanly.

The project was built incrementally while learning Python fundamentals and debugging real logical issues along the way.

## 🧰 Supported Operators

| Operator | Description            |
|--------|------------------------|
| `+`    | Addition               |
| `-`    | Subtraction            |
| `*`    | Multiplication         |
| `/`    | Division               |
| `**`   | Power (exponentiation) |
| `^`    | Square (custom unary)  |

🧪 Example Usage
Enter a number: 5
Available operators: + - * / ** ^
Choose the operator: *
Enter the second number: 4
Result: 20
History: [20]

Continue with last result? (y = yes, n = reset, q = quit): y
Choose the operator: ^
Result: 400
History: [20, 400]

📚 What I Learned

~This project helped me practice and understand:
~Python functions and dictionaries
~Input validation with try/except
~Loop control and program state
~Handling edge cases gracefully
~Separating logic into reusable functions
~Debugging logic errors (not just syntax)
~Writing more readable and maintainable code

Most importantly, it taught me how to think step-by-step like a programmer.

🤝 A Note for Fellow Learners

This project was built while learning, not after “mastering” Python.
If you’re also learning and feel overwhelmed at times — that’s part of the process.
Progress comes from building, breaking, fixing, and finishing.
